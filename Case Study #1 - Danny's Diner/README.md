## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent, and which menu items are their favorites.

Danny has shared 3 key datasets:
- sales
- menu
- members

The entity relationship diagram is as below:

    END) AS points_collected
FROM

    join_date, 
    DATE_ADD(join_date, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AS valid_date
FROM members) 

SELECT
    p.customer_id, 
    SUM(CASE
		WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN p.join_date AND p.valid_date THEN price*10*2
        WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price*10*2
        ELSE price*10 
    END) AS points_collected 
FROM sales s JOIN promo_week p ON s.customer_id = p.customer_id
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
      AND s.order_date <= '2021-01-31'
    GROUP BY p.customer_id
    ORDER BY p.customer_id;
```

**Answer:**
