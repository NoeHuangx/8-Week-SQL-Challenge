## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent, and which menu items are their favorites.

Danny has shared 3 key datasets:
- sales
- menu
- members

The entity relationship diagram is as below:

## Questions and Solutions 
### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant? 

```mysql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

**Steps:**
- `INNER JOIN` `sales` and `menu` tables using `product_id` because `customer_id` can be found on the `sales` table while `price` can be found on the `menu`.
- `GROUP BY` `customer_id` then use the aggregate function `SUM` to find the amount each customer spent and `ORDER BY` `customer_id`.   

**Answer:**
|customer_id | total_spent |
|------------|-------------|
|A           | 76          |
|B           | 74          |
|C           | 36          |


### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```mysql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Use `GROUP BY` to group `customer_id` then use aggregate function `COUNT`.
- While using `COUNT` function, add `DISTINCT` to only include unique `order_date` values, instead of counting all the dates with repetitive data. 

**Answer:**
| customer_id | visit_count|
|-------------|------------|
|A            | 4          |
|B            | 6          |
|C            | 2          |


### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

```mysql
WITH order_rank AS (
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rnk
	FROM
		sales s
			JOIN
		menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id)
    
SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_date FROM order_rank WHERE rnk = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name; 
```

**Steps:**
- Create a common table expression (CTE) called `order_rank`. Within the CTE, create a new column called `rnk` using `DENSE_RANK()`,`PARTITION BY customer_id`, and `ORDER BY order_date`. `PARTITION BY` divides the data into groups based on `customer_id`, while `ORDER BY` arranges the data based on `order_date` then `DENSE_RANK` creates rank numbers within each data group. 
- Select the data from the CTE only where `rnk` is equal to 1. 

**Answer:** 
|customer_id |product_name |order_date|
|------------|-------------|----------|
|A           |sushi        |2021-01-01|
|A           |curry        |2021-01-01|
|B           |curry        |2021-01-01|
|C           |ramen        |2021-01-01|


### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

```mysql
SELECT 
    m.product_name,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 1; 
```

**Steps:** 
- `INNER JOIN` `sales` and `menu` table using `product_id`. 
- `GROUP BY` `product_name` to use the aggregate function `COUNT` to get the number of times each item is ordered, then `ORDER BY` the new column created by `COUNT` in descending order and limit the output to 1 to get the most purchased item. 

**Answer:** 
|product_name|order_count|
|------------|-----------|
|ramen       |8          |


### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

```mysql
WITH units_sold AS (
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    m.product_name,
    COUNT(m.product_name) AS order_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.customer_id) DESC) AS rnk
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name) 

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count
FROM units_sold WHERE rnk = 1; 
```

**Steps:**
- Create a common table expression(CTE) called `units_sold` by joining sales and menu tables using `product_id` and `GROUP BY` `customer_id` and `product_name`. Then, `customer_id`, `product_name`, a new column named `order_count` created by using the `COUNT` function, and second new column named `rnk` created by using `DENSE_RANK()` function, are selected into `units_sold` CTE.
- Simply, select `customer_id`, `product_name` and `order_count` from `units_sold` CTE where `rnk` is equal to 1. 

**Answer:**
|customer_id|product_name|order_count|
|-----------|------------|-----------|
|A          |ramen       |3          |
|B          |curry       |2          |
|B          |sushi       |2          |
|B          |ramen       |2          |
|C          |ramen       |3          |


### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

```mysql
WITH order_after_member AS (
SELECT 
	s.customer_id, s.order_date, mm.join_date, m.product_name,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rnk 
FROM sales s JOIN members mm ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date >= DATE(mm.join_date)
ORDER BY s.customer_id)

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_date, join_date
FROM order_after_member WHERE rnk = 1;
```

**Steps:**
- Create CTE named `order_afer_member` by joining the `sales`, `members`, and `menu` tables. Then, select `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, `join_date`, and a new column called `rnk` by using `DENSE_RANK()` with `PARTITION BY customer_id` and `ORDER BY order_date` into `order_after_member` CTE. And, filter the CTE only to have data where `order_date` is after the `join_date`.
- Then simply select data from `order_after_member` CTE where `rnk` is equal to 1. 

**Answer:**
|customer_id|product_name|order_date|join_date |
|-----------|------------|----------|--------- |
|A          |curry       |2021-01-07|2021-01-07|
|B          |sushi       |2021-01-11|2021-01-09|


## 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

```mysql
WITH order_before_member AS (
SELECT 
	s.customer_id, s.order_date, mm.join_date, m.product_name,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rnk 
FROM sales s JOIN members mm ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < DATE(mm.join_date)
ORDER BY s.customer_id) 

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_date, join_date
FROM order_before_member WHERE rnk = 1;
```

**Steps:**
- Similar to question 6, create a CTE called `order_before_member` by joining all three tables while filtering out the data where `order_date` is after `join_date`. And, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, `join_date`, and a new column called `rnk` by using `DENSE_RANK()` with `PARTITION BY customer_id` and `ORDER BY order_date DESC` are added into the `order_before_member` CTE.
- Select data from the CTE where `rnk` is equal to 1. 

**Answer:**
|customer_id|product_name|order_date|join_date |
|-----------|------------|----------|--------- |
|A          |sushi       |2021-01-01|2021-01-07|
|A          |curry       |2021-01-01|2021-01-07|
|B          |sushi       |2021-01-04|2021-01-09|


### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

```mysql
WITH before_member AS ( 
SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, s.product_id, mm.join_date
FROM sales s JOIN members mm ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < mm.join_date)

SELECT b.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS items_count, 
	SUM(m.price) AS total_amount_spent 
FROM before_member b JOIN menu m ON b.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY b.customer_id
ORDER BY b.customer_id;
```

**Steps:**
- Create CTE called `before_member` by joining `sales` and `members` tables and filter the data only to have the data where `order_date` is before `join_date`.
- Select `customer_id`, use `COUNT` to get the total item counts, and use `SUM` for the total amount spent from the `before_member` CTE. 

**Answer:**
|customer_id|items_count|total_amount_spent|
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
|A          |2          | 25               |
|B          |3          | 40               |


### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

```mysql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN m.product_id = 1 THEN m.price * 10 * 2
        ELSE m.price * 10
    END) AS points_collected
FROM
    menu m
        JOIN
    sales s ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id; 
```

**Steps:** 
- Join `sales` and `menu` tables using `product_id`, then `GROUP BY` customer_id
- Use `CASE` to set up the scenario when `product_id` equals one, multiply the price by 20. Otherwise, multiply the price by 10. 

**Answer:**
| customer_id |points_collected|
|-------------|----------------|
|A            | 860            |
|B            | 940            |
|C            | 360            |


### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customers A and B have at the end of January?

```mysql
WITH promo_week AS (
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
    join_date, 
    DATE_ADD(join_date, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AS valid_date
FROM members) 

SELECT
	p.customer_id, 
    SUM(CASE
		WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN p.join_date AND p.valid_date THEN price*10*2
        WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price*10*2
        ELSE price*10 
    END) AS points_collected 
    FROM sales s JOIN promo_week p ON s.customer_id = p.customer_id
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
      AND s.order_date <= '2021-01-31'
    GROUP BY p.customer_id
    ORDER BY p.customer_id;
```

**Steps:** 
- Create a CTE named `promo_week` using the `members` table. Use `DATE_ADD` to create the promotional period for each user, which is the first week of customers joining the membership.
- Join the `sales` and `menu` tables with the `promo_week` CTE and `GROUP BY` customer_id, then filter  only to have January data.
- Use `CASE` to set up the scenario where `order_date` is the first week of joining the membership, it is 20 times item price. After the first week, the sushi is 20 times item price, while the rest are 10 times item price. Then, `SUM` all the results from `CASE` to calculate the points_collected. 

**Answer:** 
| customer_id |points_collected|
|-------------|----------------|
|A            | 1370           |
|B            | 820            |
