## Business Task
Danny requires assistance to clean the data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

Danny has provided an entity relationship diagram of his database as below:

## Data Cleaning 

### Table: customer_orders

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/NoeHuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/148400128/558b0be8-6ceb-48fd-a8c7-ad70f3c0087b">
</p>

**Cleaning Process:**
- From `customer_orders` table as seen above, all the blank spaces and "null" strings in `exclusions` and `extras`columns are replaced as `NULL` value for data consistency in temporary table called `temp_customer_orders`. 

```mysql
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS temp_customer_orders; 
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_customer_orders (
	SELECT 
		order_id, 
    customer_id, 
    pizza_id, 
    CASE
			WHEN exclusions = '' THEN NULL
			WHEN exclusions LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL
      ELSE exclusions
    END AS exclusions, 
    CASE
			WHEN extras = '' THEN NULL
			WHEN extras LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL
      ELSE extras
    END AS extras, 
        order_time
  FROM customer_orders
);
```

### Table: runner_orders

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/NoeHuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/148400128/9c8fbadd-e00d-432b-963f-3ce1212965cd">
</p>

**Cleaning Process:**
- From `runner_orders` table as seen above, all the "null" strings are replaced as `NULL` value across all columns in temporary table `temp_runner_orders`.
- From `distance` and `duration` columns, the texts are removed from the stringed numerical values, and the columns' names are updated to `distance_in_km` and `duration_in_minute`.
- Then, the data types of `pickup_time`, `distance_in_km` and `duration_in_minute` are modified to `TIMESTAMP`,`FLOAT` and `INT`. 

```mysql
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS temp_runner_orders; 
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_runner_orders (
	SELECT 
		order_id, 
    runner_id, 
    CASE
			WHEN pickup_time LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL
      ELSE pickup_time
    END AS pickup_time, 
		CASE 
			WHEN distance LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL
      ELSE  TRIM('km' FROM distance)
    END AS distance_in_km, 
    CASE 
			WHEN duration LIKE '%null%' OR NULL THEN NULL
      WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes%' THEN TRIM('minutes' FROM duration)
      WHEN duration LIKE '%minute%' THEN TRIM('minute' FROM duration)
      WHEN duration LIKE '%mins%' THEN TRIM('mins' FROM duration)
      ELSE duration
    END AS duration_in_minute, 
    CASE
			WHEN cancellation = '' THEN NULL
			WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN NULL
      WHEN cancellation LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL
      ELSE cancellation
    END AS cancellation
FROM runner_orders
);

ALTER TABLE temp_runner_orders 
MODIFY COLUMN pickup_time TIMESTAMP,
MODIFY COLUMN distance_in_km FLOAT, 
MODIFY COLUMN duration_in_minute INT; 
```

### B. Runner and Customer Experience
#### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

```mysql
SELECT 
    WEEK(registration_date) AS week_num,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM
    runners
GROUP BY week_num;
```

**Answer:**
|week_num|count|
|--------|-----|
|0       |1    |
|1       |2    |
|2       |1    |


#### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

```mysql
SELECT 
    r.runner_id,
    MINUTE(AVG(TIMEDIFF(r.pickup_time, c.order_time))) AS avg_pickup_duration
FROM
    temp_customer_orders c
        JOIN
    temp_runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE
    r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY r.runner_id;
```

**Answer:** 
|runner_id|avg_pickup_duration|
|---------|-------------------|
|1        |15                 |
|2        |23                 |
|3        |10                 |


#### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

```mysql
WITH duration_cte AS (
SELECT 
    COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS num_of_pizza,
    MINUTE(TIMEDIFF(r.pickup_time, c.order_time)) AS time_before_pickup
FROM
    temp_customer_orders c
        JOIN
    temp_runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE
    r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.order_id)

SELECT 
	num_of_pizza, 
    AVG(time_before_pickup) AS avg_prep_time 
FROM duration_cte
GROUP BY num_of_pizza;
```

**Answer:**
|num_of_pizza|avg_prep_time|
|------------|-------------|
|1           |12.0000      |
|2           |18.0000      |
|3           |29.0000      |

It seems like the larger the number of pizzas order, the longer the prep time is.

**Note:** I have disabled the `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` mode for the session running this query with the following code: 
```mysql
SET sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));
```


#### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

```mysql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    CAST(AVG(r.distance_in_km) AS DECIMAL (4 , 2 )) AS avg_distance_km
FROM
    temp_customer_orders c
        JOIN
    temp_runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE
    r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```

**Answer:** 
|customer_id|avg_distance_km|
|-----------|---------------|
|101        |20.00          |
|102        |16.73          |
|103        |23.40          |
|104        |10.00          |
|105        |25.00          |


#### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

```mysql
SELECT 
    MAX(duration_in_minute) AS max_duration,
    MIN(duration_in_minute) AS min_duration,
    MAX(duration_in_minute) - MIN(duration_in_minute) AS time_difference
FROM
    temp_runner_orders; 
```

**Answer:** 
|max_duration|min_duration|time_difference|
|------------|------------|---------------|
|40          |10          |30             |


#### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

```mysql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    pickup_time,
    distance_in_km,
    duration_in_minute,
    ROUND((distance_in_km / (duration_in_minute / 60)),
            2) AS speed
FROM
    temp_runner_orders
WHERE
    pickup_time IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

**Answer:**

speed = distance in km / duration in hour

|runner_id|     pickup_time   |distance_in_km|duration_in_minute|speed|
|---------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|-----|
|1        |2020-01-01 18:15:34|20            |32                |37.5 |
|1        |2020-01-01 19:10:54|20            |27                |44.44|
|1        |2020-01-03 00:12:37|13.4          |20                |40.2 |
|1        |2020-01-11 18:50:20|10            |10                |60   |
|2        |2020-01-04 13:53:03|23.4          |40                |35.1 |
|2        |2020-01-08 21:30:45|25            |25                |60   |
|2        |2020-01-10 00:15:02|23.4          |15                |93.6 |
|3        |2020-01-08 21:10:57|10            |15                |40   |

I do not notice any trend. 


#### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

```mysql
WITH orders_cte AS (
SELECT 
	runner_id, 
    SUM(IF(pickup_time IS NOT NULL, 1, 0)) AS success_orders, 
    SUM(IF(pickup_time IS NULL, 1, 0))AS fail_orders,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM temp_runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id) 

SELECT runner_id, 
	(success_orders/total_orders)*100 AS success_percentage
FROM orders_cte
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

**Answer:**
|runner_id|success_percentage|
|---------|------------------|
|1        |100.0000          |
|2        |75.0000           |
|3        |50.0000           |

#### 5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
- For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"

```mysql
WITH ingridients AS (
	SELECT 
		c.*, 
        pn.pizza_name,
        CASE
			WHEN pr.topping_id IN (c.exclusions) THEN NULL
			WHEN pr.topping_id IN (c.extras) THEN CONCAT('2x ' , pt.topping_name)
            ELSE pt.topping_name
        END AS toppings 
	FROM temp_pizza_recipes pr
    JOIN pizza_names pn ON pn.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
    JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON pr.topping_id = pt.topping_id
    JOIN temp_customer_orders_split c ON pr.pizza_id = c.pizza_id 
)

SELECT
    order_id,
    pizza_id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT exclusions) as exclusions, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT extras) as extras,
    CONCAT(pizza_name, ': ', GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT toppings SEPARATOR ', ')) AS pizza_info 
FROM ingridients
GROUP BY row_num;
```
  
**Answer:**
|order_id|pizza_id|exclusions|extras|pizza_info|
|--------|--------|----------|------|----------|
|1       |1       |NULL      |NULL  |Meatlovers: Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami|

#### 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

```mysql
WITH ingredients AS (
	SELECT 
		pt.topping_name, 
        CASE
			      WHEN pr.topping_id IN (c.extras) THEN 2
            WHEN pr.topping_id IN (c.exclusions) THEN 0 
            ELSE 1
        END AS qty
FROM temp_pizza_recipes pr 
JOIN temp_customer_orders_split c ON c.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id 
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id = pr.topping_id
)

SELECT 
	topping_name, 
    SUM(qty) AS total_qty
FROM ingredients 
GROUP BY topping_name
ORDER BY total_qty DESC;
```

**Answer:**
|topping_name|total_qty|

### D. Pricing and Ratings
#### 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```mysql
SELECT 
	pn.pizza_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS qty,
    SUM(CASE
		WHEN pn.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
        ELSE 10
    END) AS total
FROM temp_customer_orders c 
JOIN pizza_names pn ON pn.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
JOIN temp_runner_orders r ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pn.pizza_name WITH ROLLUP;
```

**Answer:** 
|pizza_name|qty|total|
|----------|---|-----|
|Meatlovers|9  |108  |
|Vegetarian|3  |30   |
|NULL      |12 |138  |


#### 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
- Add cheese is $1 extra

```mysql
WITH pizza_base AS (
SELECT 
	c.order_id,
    CASE
		WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
        ELSE 10
    END AS pizza_cost, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT c.extras) AS extras
FROM temp_customer_orders_split c 
JOIN temp_runner_orders r ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.row_num
)

SELECT 
	SUM(CASE
		WHEN extras IS NULL THEN pizza_cost
        WHEN CHAR_LENGTH(extras) = 1 THEN pizza_cost + 1
        ELSE pizza_cost + 2
    END) AS total_revenue 
FROM pizza_base;
```

**Answer:** 
|total_revenue|
|-------------|
|142          |


#### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

```mysql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rating; 
CREATE TABLE rating (
	order_id INT NOT NULL, 
    ratings INT NOT NULL,
    reviews VARCHAR(255) NULL
); 

INSERT INTO rating(order_id, ratings, reviews)
VALUES 
	(1, 4, 'the pizza tastes good, but service is okay'),
    (2, 5, NULL), 
    (10, 5, 'the pizza were awesome and service is super fast'), 
    (4, 1, 'it takes forever for the pizza to get delivered to me and pizza arrives cold'), 
    (3, 3, 'it is alright, nothing special'), 
    (5, 5, 'craving satisfy without leaving the house'), 
    (8, 5, 'super fast and pizza tastes good. would recommend'), 
    (7, 2, NULL);
```

**Answer:**
|order_id|ratings|reviews                  |
|--------|-------|-------------------------|
|1       |4      |the pizza tastes good, but service is okay|
|2       |5      |NULL                      |
|10      |5      |the pizza were awesome and service is super fast|
|4       |1      |it takes forever for the pizza to get delivered to me and pizza arrives cold|
|3       |3      |it is alright, nothing special|
|5       |5      |craving satisfy without leaving the house|
|8       |5      |super fast and pizza tastes good. would recommend|
|7       |2      |NULL|


#### 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id
- order_id
- runner_id
- rating
- order_time
- pickup_time
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas

```mysql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id, 
    c.order_id, 
    tr.runner_id, 
    r.ratings,
    c.order_time, 
    tr.pickup_time, 
    MINUTE(TIMEDIFF(tr.pickup_time, c.order_time)) AS 'time_between_order_and_pickup',
    tr.duration_in_minute AS delivery_duration, 
    ROUND((tr.distance_in_km)/(tr.duration_in_minute/60), 2) AS average_speed, 
    COUNT(pizza_id) AS total_pizza
FROM temp_customer_orders c 
JOIN temp_runner_orders tr ON tr.order_id = c.order_id 
JOIN rating r ON r.order_id = c.order_id 
WHERE tr.cancellation IS NULL 
GROUP BY c.order_id; 
```

**Answer:**
|customer_id|order_id|runner_id|ratings|order_time|pickup_time |time_between_order_and_pickup|delivery_duration|avg_speed|total_pizza|
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|----------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------|-----------|

#### 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

```mysql
WITH accounting AS (
	SELECT 
		SUM(IF(c.pizza_id = 1, 12, 10)) AS pizza_revenue, 
        distance_in_km,
        ROUND((r.distance_in_km * 0.30),2) AS runner_fees
	FROM temp_customer_orders c 
    JOIN temp_runner_orders r ON r.order_id = c.order_id 
    WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
)

SELECT 
	(SUM(pizza_revenue) - SUM(runner_fees)) AS total_profit 
FROM accounting;
```

**Answer:**
|total_profit|
|------------|
|132.00      |


### E. Bonus Questions
#### If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?
