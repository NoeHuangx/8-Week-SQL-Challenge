### Bonus Challenge 
#### Use a single SQL query to transform the `product_hierarchy` and `product_prices` datasets to the `product_details` table. 
#### Hint: You may want to consider using a recursive CTE to solve this problem. 

```mysql
SELECT 
	pp.product_id, 
    pp.price, 
    CONCAT(ph1.level_text, " ", ph2.level_text, " - ", ph3.level_text) AS product_name, 
    ph3.id AS category_id, 
    ph2.id AS segment_id, 
    ph1.id AS style_id, 
    ph3.level_text AS category_name, 
    ph2.level_text AS segment_name, 
    ph1.level_text AS style_name
FROM product_hierarchy ph1
JOIN product_prices pp ON ph1.id = pp.id
JOIN product_hierarchy ph2 ON ph1.parent_id = ph2.id 
JOIN product_hierarchy ph3 ON ph2.parent_id = ph3.id
ORDER BY style_id; 
```
