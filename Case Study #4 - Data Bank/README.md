## Questions and Solutions

	customer_nodes;
```

**Answer:** 
|node_count|
|----------|
|5         |


#### 2. What is the number of nodes per region?

```mysql
SELECT 
    r.region_name,
    r.region_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.node_id) AS node_count
FROM
    regions r
        JOIN
    customer_nodes c ON r.region_id = c.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_id
ORDER BY r.region_id;
```

**Answer:**
|region_name|region_id|node_count|
|-----------|---------|----------|
|Australia  |1        |5         |

|Europe     |5        |5         |


#### 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?

```mysql
SELECT 
	r.region_name, 
    r.region_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM 
	regions r
JOIN 
	customer_nodes c ON r.region_id = c.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_id
ORDER BY r.region_id; 
```

**Answer:** 
|region_name|region_id|customer_count|
|-----------|---------|--------------|
|Australia  |1|110|
|America|2|105|
|Africa|3|102|
|Asia|4|95|
|Europe|5|88|


#### 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

```mysql
-- To check if start_date and end_date are correct
SELECT DISTINCT
    start_date
FROM
    customer_nodes
ORDER BY start_date DESC;

SELECT DISTINCT
    end_date
FROM
    customer_nodes
ORDER BY end_date DESC;

-- calculate the average number of days 
SELECT 	
	FLOOR(AVG(DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date))) AS avg_days
FROM 
	customer_nodes
WHERE YEAR(end_date) != 9999; 
```

**Answer:** 
|avg_days|
|--------|
|14|


#### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?


### B. Customer Transactions 
#### 1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```mysql
SELECT 
    txn_type,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    SUM(txn_amount) AS total
FROM
    customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type; 
```

**Answer:**
|txn_type|count|total|
|--------|-----|-----|

WITH cte AS (
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS deposit_count, 
    SUM(txn_amount) AS amount
FROM 
	customer_transactions
WHERE txn_type = "deposit"
GROUP BY customer_id)

SELECT
	AVG(deposit_count) AS avg_count, 
    AVG(amount) AS avg_amount 
FROM cte; 
```

**Answer:** 
|avg_count|avg_amount|
|---------|----------|
|5.3420|2718.3360|


#### 3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

	SELECT 
		customer_id, 
		MONTHNAME(txn_date) AS month_name,
        MONTH(txn_date) AS month_id, 
        SUM(IF(txn_type = "deposit", 1, 0)) AS deposit_count, 
        SUM(IF(txn_type = "purchase", 1, 0)) AS purchase_count, 
        SUM(IF(txn_type = "withdrawal", 1, 0)) AS withdrawal_count
	FROM customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id, month_name
)

SELECT 
	month_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM cte
WHERE deposit_count > 1 AND (purchase_count = 1 OR withdrawal_count = 1)

SELECT

        SUM(IF(txn_type = "deposit", txn_amount, -1 * txn_amount)) AS amount 
	FROM customer_transactions 
    GROUP BY customer_id, MONTHNAME(txn_date) 
), 

total AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id, 
        month_id,
        month_name, 
        SUM(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month_id) AS total_amount 
	FROM cte
),

balance AS (
	SELECT 
		*,
        LAG(total_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month_id) AS start_b,
        total_amount AS end_b
	FROM total
),

percent AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id, 
		((end_b - start_b)*100)/start_b AS change_percent
