	FROM 
		events e
	JOIN page_hierarchy p ON p.page_id = e.page_id

### B. Product Funnel Analysis 

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

How many times was each product viewed?
How many times was each product added to cart?
How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
How many times was each product purchased?
Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

```mysql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_info; 
CREATE TABLE product_info (
WITH product_info AS (
	SELECT 
		e.visit_id,
        e.event_type, 
        p.page_name AS product_name, 
        p.product_category, 
        p.product_id
	FROM 
		events e
	JOIN page_hierarchy p ON p.page_id = e.page_id       
), 

page_cart AS (
	SELECT 
		product_id, 
        product_name, 
        product_category, 
        CASE
			WHEN event_type = 1 THEN visit_id 
        END AS views_id, 
        CASE
			WHEN event_type = 2 THEN visit_id 
        END AS cart_id 
	FROM 
		product_info
), 

purchase_cte AS (
	SELECT 
		visit_id AS purchase_id 
	FROM events 
	WHERE event_type = 3
)

SELECT
	product_id, 
    product_name, 
    product_category, 
    COUNT(views_id) AS page_views, 
    COUNT(cart_id) AS added_to_cart, 
    COUNT(cart_id) - COUNT(purchase_id) AS abandoned,
    COUNT(purchase_id) AS purchase_count
FROM 	
	page_cart pc
LEFT JOIN purchase_cte p ON pc.cart_id = p.purchase_id
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY product_id); 
```

**Answer:**
|product_id|product_name|product_catetory|page_views|added_to_cart|abandoned|purchase_count|
|----------|------------|----------------|----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
|1|Salmon|Fish|1559|938|227|711|
