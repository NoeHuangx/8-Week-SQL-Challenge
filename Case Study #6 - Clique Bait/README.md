### B. Product Funnel Analysis 

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?


```mysql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_info; 
CREATE TABLE product_info (
WITH product_info AS (
	SELECT 
		e.visit_id,
        e.event_type, 
        p.page_name AS product_name, 
        p.product_category, 
        p.product_id
	FROM 
		events e
	JOIN page_hierarchy p ON p.page_id = e.page_id       
), 

page_cart AS (
	SELECT 
		product_id, 
        product_name, 
        product_category, 
        CASE
			WHEN event_type = 1 THEN visit_id 
        END AS views_id, 
        CASE
			WHEN event_type = 2 THEN visit_id 
        END AS cart_id 
	FROM 
		product_info
), 

purchase_cte AS (
	SELECT 
		visit_id AS purchase_id 
	FROM events 
	WHERE event_type = 3
)

SELECT
	product_id, 
    product_name, 
    product_category, 
    COUNT(views_id) AS page_views, 
    COUNT(cart_id) AS added_to_cart, 
    COUNT(cart_id) - COUNT(purchase_id) AS abandoned,
    COUNT(purchase_id) AS purchase_count
FROM 	
	page_cart pc
LEFT JOIN purchase_cte p ON pc.cart_id = p.purchase_id
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY product_id); 
```

**Answer:**
|product_id|product_name|product_catetory|page_views|added_to_cart|abandoned|purchase_count|
|----------|------------|----------------|----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
|1|Salmon|Fish|1559|938|227|711|
|2|Kingfish|Fish|1559|920|213|707|
|3|Tuna|Fish|1515|931|234|697|
|4|Russian Caviar|Luxury|1563|946|249|697|
|5|Black Truffle|Luxury|1469|924|217|707|
|6|Abalone|Shellfish|1525|932|233|699|
|7|Lobster|Shellfish|1547|968|214|754|
|8|Crab|Shellfish|1564|949|230|719|
|9|Oyster|Shellfish|1568|943|217|726|


Additionally, create another table that further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

```mysql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_category_info; 
CREATE TABLE product_category_info (
WITH product_info AS (
	SELECT 
		e.visit_id,
        e.event_type, 
        p.page_name AS product_name, 
        p.product_category, 
        p.product_id
	FROM 
		events e
	JOIN page_hierarchy p ON p.page_id = e.page_id       
), 

page_cart AS (
	SELECT 
		product_id, 
        product_name, 
        product_category, 
        CASE
			WHEN event_type = 1 THEN visit_id 
        END AS views_id, 
        CASE
			WHEN event_type = 2 THEN visit_id 
        END AS cart_id 
	FROM 
		product_info
), 

purchase_cte AS (
	SELECT 
		visit_id AS purchase_id 
	FROM events 
	WHERE event_type = 3
)

SELECT
    product_category, 
    COUNT(views_id) AS page_views, 
    COUNT(cart_id) AS added_to_cart, 
    COUNT(cart_id) - COUNT(purchase_id) AS abandoned,
    COUNT(purchase_id) AS purchase_count
FROM 	
	page_cart pc
LEFT JOIN purchase_cte p ON pc.cart_id = p.purchase_id
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY product_category); 
```

**Answer:** 
|product_category|page_views|added_to_cart|abandoned|purchase_count|
|----------------|----------|-------------|---------|--------------|
|Fish|4633|2789|674|2115|
|Luxury|3032|1870|466|1404|
|Shellfish|6204|3792|894|2898|

### C. Campaigns Analysis 
Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

- user_id
- visit_id
- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
- page_views: count of page views for each visit
- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
- click: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

```mysql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS campaign_analysis; 
CREATE TABLE campaign_analysis (
SELECT 
	u.user_id, 
    e.visit_id, 
    MIN(e.event_time) AS visit_start_time, 
    SUM(IF(ei.event_name = 'Page View', 1, 0)) AS page_views, 
    SUM(IF(ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart', 1, 0)) AS cart_adds, 
    SUM(IF(ei.event_name = 'Purchase', 1, 0)) AS purchase, 
    c.campaign_name, 
    SUM(IF(ei.event_name = 'Ad Impression', 1, 0)) AS impression, 
    SUM(IF(ei.event_name = 'Ad Click', 1, 0)) AS click,
    GROUP_CONCAT(
 		CASE
 			WHEN p.product_id IS NOT NULL AND ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' 
 				THEN p.page_name
 			ELSE NULL
		END ORDER BY e.sequence_number SEPARATOR ', ') AS cart_products  
FROM events e
JOIN users u ON u.cookie_id = e.cookie_id
JOIN event_identifier ei ON ei.event_type = e.event_type
LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier c ON e.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
JOIN page_hierarchy p ON p.page_id = e.page_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, e.visit_id
ORDER BY u.user_id); 
```

**Answer:** 


*I am only showing the result for user_id 1 from `campaign_analysis`.*
